# Project 1: k-means Clustering of Movie Ratings
 In this project, the data we're going to use comes from the wonderful MovieLens user ratings dataset. We'll look at individual movie ratings later in the notebook, after we've compared genre ratings.

# Project 2: Hierarchical Clustering Lab
In this notebook, we will be using sklearn to conduct hierarchical clustering on the Iris dataset which contains 4 dimensions/attributes and 150 samples. Each sample is labeled as one of the three type of Iris flowers.

# Project 3: DBSCAN Notebook
In this notebook, we will use DBSCAN to cluster a couple of datasests.
